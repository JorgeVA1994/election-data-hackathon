# Trump vs Staff Tweets

This dataset provides recent tweets from the [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump) Twitter account, collected by David Robinson.  He provides an overview of his analysis below:

"My analysis concludes that the Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people, posting during different times of day and using hashtags, links, and retweets in distinct ways. Whatâ€™s more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures."

## Files 

The Rmd file below processes the tweets using [tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html) and then trains a binary classifier using the [h2o](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/h2o/index.html) R package.  The resulting model can then be used to determine the source of future Donald Trump tweets.
